# Controlled Substances

_This page current as of 21 June 2017._

For anesthetizing mice during surgery and some other procedures, we use ketamine. Ketamine is a DEA controlled substance in Schedule 3.

Since it is a controlled substance, there are some special considerations regarding its procurement, storage, usage, and disposal.

Currently, we do not use any other controlled substances, but if we start using another one, the procedures listed on this page will most likely apply to that substance as well.

## Procurement

Just make a regular requisition in eProcurement for a purchase from Patterson Veterinary Supply, for [KetaVed 100 mg/mL, 10 mL](https://www.pattersonvet.com/ProductItem/078908598).

The only differences from a normal requisition are:

- In the **Comment for Supplier** field, put in "Dr. Daniel Moore, account number \[number\]."
- When it asks if HIPAA is applicable to this purchase, select "No".

## Storage

  Any vial with ketamine in it must be kept in a locked box, in a locked drawer.

We have two lockboxes, one for fresh drugs, and the other for drugs that are expired or used up. It is recommended to keep expired drugs in the separate box until they are disposed so that they are less likely to be accidentally used on mice.

All drugs and drug mixtures - anything that will be used in survival procedures - must have the correct expiration date clearly marked on the outside of the container. Drugs in their original containers will have this marked on their label. See below for considerations for drug mixtures.

### Drug mixtures

Drug mixtures \(e.g. ketamine + saline\) must have a label clearly indicating what drugs are mixed and the accurate expiration date of the mixture.

The expiration date of a drug mixture is the earliest expiration date between the two. For example, if the ketamine expires on 28 Feb 2019 and the saline expires on 30 Nov 2018, the expiration date of the mixture is 30 Nov 2018.

## Recordkeeping

Whenever you use a controlled substance, you must record how much you use on the Controlled Substance Usage Log corresponding to that vial.

Each vial of pure ketamine and for each vial of ketamine/saline mixture should have its own log. Here is an example of a log:

[example-usage-log.pdf](.gitbook/assets/example-usage-log.pdf)

For ease of sharing amongst the lab members and to save the beautiful trees of the earth, I've been keeping our logs as spreadsheets in Google Drive. You should have access to these files, so you can just copy one and change the information as needed for new vials.

The inspectors will want to see these logs during [mouse inspection](mouses/inspection.md), so keep them up to date and accurate.

## Disposal

To properly dispose of controlled substances, they must be solidified.

We should have some solidifier in lab:

![solidifier](.gitbook/assets/controlled-substances-00001.jpg)

If we do not, you can obtain some by contacting the VEHS Animal Care Safety Officer \(ACSO\), which at this time is Marisa Scott.

Figure out how many milliliters of controlled substance you need to dispose of. Divide that in half. This is how much solidifier you should use.

Place the determined amount of solidifier into a 15 mL conical tube.

Draw the controlled substance out of its vial and inject it into the conical tube with the solidifier. If all of the liquid does not absorb into the solidifier, add more solidifier.

Label the tube with "Expired \[name of drug\], for Disposal".

Fill out the DEA disposal form \([DEA Form 41](https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr_reports/surrend/index.html)\).

Take the conical with solidified drug to the window at MCN S-1310. This is on the first floor of MCN, on the main hallway to the mouse room elevators. Tell them you have controlled substance for disposal, and they'll handle it from there.
