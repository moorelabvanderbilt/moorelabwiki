# Sexing

**Sexing** is the practice of differentiating male mice from female mice.

## Females

Female mice are identifiable by the vagina and presence of nipples.

The vagina is very close to the anus, with little to no hair in between the two. It also protrudes less from the body than the male's penis does.

Female mice have nipples, where male mice do not. They are easiest to see on mice with dark-colored fur.

## Males

Male mice are identifiable by the penis, testicles, and absence of nipples.

The penis is spaced further away from the anus, with a small strip of hair between the two. It protrudes visibly from the body.

Testicles are often apparent on older males. They appear as a swollen area around the penis and anus.

Male mice do not have nipples. However, nipples are difficult to see on light-colored, young female mice, so their absence should not be the only factor in determining the sex of a mouse.

Male mice tend to be slightly larger than female mice, especially in older mice.
