*This page current as of 29 June 2017.*

This page is a set of guides on how to do various random stuff in the mouse room.

# Water restriction
### Lix-it
The Lix-it is the metal tube at the back of the slots in the racks. Mice can lick this metal tube to get water, which is supplied via plumbing to the rack. 

If the Lix-it begins to leak, the cage attached in that slot can flood. Remove the cage from that slot and place it elsewhere. If the cage has flooded, move the mice to a new cage and place a bunch of paper towels in the cage so they can dry off more easily. Place a paper towel under the leaky Lix-it to prevent water from leaking onto the floor. This also serves to notify DAC that the Lix-it at that location is leaking, so they can replace it.

### Lix-it stopper

The Lix-it stopper is a small metal stopper that can be placed on individual Lix-its to prevent the cage in that slot from accessing the water coming in from the wall. If a Lix-it stopper is placed on a cage's water source, the cage *must* have a water bottle in it, since otherwise the mice will die of thirst.

### No-water rack
One of the racks in 7216E is completely disconnected from the water system. It is labeled as such on a small card on the top-center of the rack.

We use this rack for our NOD.RAG-/- mice, to prevent us from having to put a Lix-it stopper on every slot that has a NOD.RAG-/- cage. Again, all cages that go on this rack *must* have a water bottle in them.
# Clean supplies (cages, bottles, etc.)
Clean supplies are found in a room at the very end of the floor, furthest from the elevators. It's hard to miss, because it says **CLEAN SUPPLIES** on the door.

Get cages, bottles, and cage card holders from this room if the ones in our room/suite run out.

# Dirty cages
Dirty cages should not be left in a mouse room. If the suite does not have a dirty cage cart, carry the dirty cages to the end of the hallway, to the left of the clean supplies room. There is a large cage cart where you can place dirty cages.

# Room levels/Moving between rooms
The rooms are numbered according to their level of cleanliness. The lower the number, the more sterile the room is.

The two rooms that we currently use are levels 4 (AA-7216E) and 5 (AA-7216B). Since level 4 rooms do not allow mice to be returned to the room after they leave, we keep a small number of mice in the level 5 room after they return from surgery. The bulk of our mouse colony lives in the level 4 room.

> This room movement guideline is true for most rooms, but due to our level 4 room's current status, we have more restrictive guidelines. See **Current Status** below.

Moving between rooms should be done from lower-numbered rooms (more sterile) to higher-numbered rooms (less sterile). For our rooms, this means we need to visit the level 4 room before visiting the level 5 room in a single day. If you have already gone to the level 5 room sometime during the day, you need to wait until tomorrow to go to the level 4 room.

### Current status

Currently, our level 4 room is technically level 4-C, which is the lowest level of sterility the room can have before being reclassified to a level 5 room. This is because there was mouse parvovirus found in a couple of the racks in 7216E, which is a non-allowed pathogen in level 4. We are currently in the process of having all of our mice tested for parvovirus. We have had two tests so far (both negative), and one more remains. If the final test comes back negative, then our room will be changed to level 4-B for one year. At the end of the year, it can be reclassified as a level 4-A.

Because of the possibility of parvovirus, which is non-allowed in either level 4 or 5 rooms, you should not move between the two rooms in either direction in a single day.

# Sacking mice in procedure room
Most of the time, placing a Sac card on the cage is sufficient. However, if there are mice in the cage that are currently a health concern (the vet has placed an orange health concern card on the cage), it is not permissible to place a Sac card on the cage. You have to sac the mice yourself.

All suites of the mouse room have an associated procedure room. This room contains a CO<sub>2</sub> dispenser that is used to sac mice. 

Remove the lid of the cage that you'd like to sac. Place the metal dispenser lid on top of the cage, ensuring the two holes in the lid are unobstructed.

Turn on the CO<sub>2</sub> valve and flip the switch on the side of the the dispenser to the on position. Change the dial to 2.

When the light on the dispenser turns green, press the red button to start the gas flow. Adjust the regulator as shown on the sign on the wall.

Wait until the machine stops dispensing gas (5 min). Turn off the machine and the CO<sub>2</sub> valve.

Remove the metal dispenser lid from the cage. Remove the mice from the cage and perform cervical dislocation to confirm death, then place them in a biohazard bag (found in one of the drawers).

Place the bagged mice in the freezer in the large biohazard bin.

# Sentinel cages
Sentinel cages are found on every rack, usually in the bottom right corner. They exist only for DAC and should not be disturbed by lab personnel.

![sentinel cage](/uploads/misc-procedures/misc-procedures-00002.jpg "they are super-mice, I guess?")

DAC uses these cages to check for the presence of any pathogenic outbreak in the room. DAC regularly takes a small amount of bedding from each cage on the rack and puts it into that rack's sentinel cage. If any of the mice on the rack have contracted some pathogen, the mice in the sentinel cage should get it as well.

# Disposing of mouse carcasses from lab
Remove the carcasses from the freezer in lab and place them in a large biohazard bag. Close the bag with tape. 

Load the bag on a cart and push it to the mouse room elevators, but go to the 8th floor. Inside the mouse area on this floor, take the bag into the first door on the right. At the back of this room, there is a walk-in freezer. In this freezer are large bins that you can place the bag in.
