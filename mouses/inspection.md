<!-- TITLE: Mouse Inspection -->

**Mouse inspection** happens every six months (in January and July) and is how Vanderbilt DAC makes sure the animal labs at Vanderbilt maintain compliance with the regulations set out by the American Association for Laboratory Animal Care (AALAC).

AALAC inspects labs at Vanderbilt about once every 3 years, so the semi-annual inspections are to keep labs ready for the AALAC inspection.

# Regulations
## Non-survival procedures
The majority of our procedures are non-survival; in other words, after the procedure is over, the mouse is dead. These are things like harvesting the spleen or bone marrow. 

For non-survival procedures, the rules revolve mostly around where and how the animal is terminated. 

We do all of our sac procedures in a glass jar with isoflurane. 

In order to sacrifice the animal in an AALAC-approved humane manner, the following steps must be followed:
1. Start with a clean jar. The jar must have been cleaned since it was last used to sac a mouse.
2. Place a gauze square in the bottom of the jar. Working in the fume hood, transfer a small amount of isoflurane to the gauze with an eyedropper.
3. Place a plastic barrier on top of the isoflurane-soaked gauze. We normally use the insert from a pipette box, cut to fit into the jar.
4. Place another gauze square on top of the barrier.
5. Place the mouse inside and close the lid.
6. Wait until the mouse has completely stopped breathing, then remove it and perform cervical dislocation to confirm death.

Repeat this process for additional mice.

## Survival procedures

Survival procedures are procedures performed on mice that are expected to live for an extended period of time after the procedure is completed.

The only survival procedure we do is islet transplantation.

### Documentation

These procedures must be documented in a Procedure Record log. This log should be similar to the form found in [the forms section of IACUC's website](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/acup/iacuc/forms/):

[rodent-procedure-record.pdf](/uploads/mouse-inspection/rodent-procedure-record.pdf "Rodent Procedure Record")

There is a Google Drive spreadsheet, **Rodent Procedure Record** in the Mouse Recordkeeping folder where a record of our survival procedures is kept.

### Drugs and materials
Any drugs and materials used in a survival procedure **MUST NOT** be expired. Anything that has an expiration date on it that has passed cannot be used in survival procedures.

If you have something that is expired that would still be viable for non-survival procedures must be clearly labeled "**FOR NON-SURVIVAL ONLY**" to avoid it accidentally being used in a survival procedure.

### Sterility

Several precautions must be taken to ensure that mice undergoing survival procedures are not exposed to non-sterile materials.

All tools used in survival procedures must be sterilized via [autoclave](/autoclave). After the tools come out of the autoclave, the bags must be labeled with the date. The tools need to be re-autoclaved after 6 months of being in the bag, as they are not guaranteed to maintain sterility after this amount of time.

Before and during survival procedures, tools should be periodically sterilized in the glass-bead sterilizer. This is a vat of hot glass beads that tools can be inserted into to sterilize tools at the surgical table.

Survival procedures should be done using sterile gloves. These are individually packaged sets of gloves that are sterile from the manufacturer.

The mouse should be shaved at the surgical site and swabbed with Betadine (povidone-iodine) swabs to sterilize the area.

### Pre-surgical care
One hour prior to surgery, the mice should be given a dose of analgesic drug. We use ketoprofen at a dose of 5-10 mg/kg for the analgesic.

Place isothermal pads into the 37&deg;C incubator to warm them for post-surgery.

Just before performing the procedure, the mouse should be given a mixture of 150 mg/kg ketamine (a dissociative) and 30 mg/kg xylazine (a muscle relaxant). This will put the mouse to sleep so that the procedure can be performed without alarm in the mouse.

The surgical site on the mouse's body should be shaved and then swabbed with Betadine swabs.

### During surgery
The mouse should be placed on a circulating water mat during surgery to help maintain the mouse's body temperature.

### Post-surgical care

Mice that have undergone survival procedures must be specially cared for after surgery.

Immediately after surgery, the mouse should be placed in a cage with an isothermal pad underneath half of it. This ensures that as the mice awaken, they can choose either the warm or cool side to sit on, so they can regulate their temperature properly.

In addition to the pre-surgical analgesic, mice should be given a dose at 24 and 48 hours after surgery (5-10 mg/kg ketoprofen). Mice typically recover quickly and exhibit no pain symptoms after this time, so the analgesic can be discontinued. However, if the mouse shows continued signs of post-operative pain at 72 hours, another dose of analgesic can be given.

## Drug storage
See [controlled substances](/controlled-substances) for more information.

Drugs should be stored behind two locking mechanisms. We store ours in a locked box in a locked drawer. 

Drugs should be clearly labeled as to what they are and the accurate expiration date.

Drug usage should be recorded accurately.

# What to expect when they're inspecting
Generally, 2-3 people from DAC will arrive at around 9-10 am to perform the inspection.

They will definitely want to see the following:

* Surgical area
* Surgery logs
* Drug box
* Drug logs
* Sacrifice jar

They will also ask questions about different animal procedures, and they will check for any drugs or materials that are expired.
