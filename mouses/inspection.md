# Inspection

**Mouse inspection** happens every six months \(in January and July\) and is how Vanderbilt DAC makes sure the animal labs at Vanderbilt maintain compliance with the regulations set out by the American Association for Laboratory Animal Care \(AALAC\).

AALAC inspects labs at Vanderbilt about once every 3 years, so the semi-annual inspections are to keep labs ready for the AALAC inspection.

See the pages for [animal procedures](procedures.md) and [drug usage](../controlled-substances.md), since these are the protocols that they will be making sure we are abiding by.

Generally, 2-3 people from DAC will arrive at around 9-10 am to perform the inspection.

They will definitely want to see the following:

- Surgical area
- Surgery logs
- Drug box
- Drug logs
- Sacrifice jar

They will also ask questions about different animal procedures, and they will check for any drugs or materials that are expired.
