  **B6.VH125+/+**

  These mice have VH125 inserted into both copies of the genome, on a B6 background.

This mouse produces B-cells that produce anti-insulin antibodies.

This mouse has an anti-insulin gene \(VH125\) inserted, replacing the endogenous IgJH3 allele. Because it is site-directed to the native IgJH3, these B-cells are able to class switch and produce both IgMa and IgDa \(as opposed to only IgMa in non-site-directed VH125Tg mice\).

### Production

This strain is maintained by breeding B6.VH125+/+ mice with each other.

It can also be achieved by breeding B6.VH125+/- mice with each other, then genotyping the pups with both protocols shown below to select the +/+ genotype.

### Genotyping VH125

This protocol confirms the presence of one _or_ two copies of the VH125 allele. It does not differentiate between mice that are heterozygous and homozygous for VH125. To confirm homozygosity, the mice must also be genotyped using the Jh3 protocol below.

**Primers**

**VH125 F**: 5’ CAG ATC CAG TTG GTG CAG TC 3’ \(20bp\) - VH125 gene  
**VH125 R**: 5’ CCA GAC ATC GAA GTA CCC CT 3’ \(20bp\) - wild-type Jh gene

## B6.VH+/+Vk+/+

These mice have both the VH125 gene and the Vk125 gene inserted into both copies of the genome, on a NOD background.

### Production

We do not yet have true-breeding mice for this strain, but we are very close. We have not had any trouble achieving homozygosity in the single-transgene \(B6.VH and B6.Vk\), so there shouldn't be an issue reaching it with these double transgenic mice.

These mice are produced by breeding mice that are at least heterozygous for both transgenes together and genotyping the pups, selecting for those that are homozygous for both.

### Genotyping

The genotyping protocols of both the B6.VH125+/+ mouse and the B6.Vk125+/+ mouse must be used to determine the genotype of this mouse.

## NOD.VH125+/+

Ideally, these mice would have VH125 inserted into both copies of the genome, on a NOD background.

However, to date, we've been unable to produce homozygous-positive mice, and therefore are stuck with heterozygotes \(VH125+/-\).

### Production

Since we have not been able to achieve homozygosity, this genotype is not actually produced.

The VH125+/- mice are produced by breeding an NOD.VH125+/- with either an NOD or another NOD.VH125+/-.

### Genotyping

The genotyping protocol is the same as the the [B6.VH125+/+ protocol](mouse-strains.md#b-6-vh-125) above.

## NOD.Vk125+/+

These mice have Vk125 inserted into both copies of the genome, on a NOD background.

### Production

This strain is maintained by breeding NOD.Vk125+/+ mice with each other.

It can also be achieved by breeding NOD.Vk125+/- mice with each other, then genotyping the pups with both protocols shown below to select the +/+ genotype.

The NOD.Vk125+/- mice are produced by breeding an NOD.Vk125+/+ with an NOD.

### Genotyping

The genotyping protocol is the same as the the [B6.Vk125+/+ protocol](mouse-strains.md#b-6-vk-125) above.

## NOD.VH+/+Vk+/+

These mice have both the VH125 gene and the Vk125 gene inserted into both copies of the genome, on a NOD background.

### Production

Because of the homozygous lethal problem with the NOD.VH125+/+ mice \(noted above\), we have been unable to produce a NOD.VH+/+Vk+/+ mouse. The closest we've gotten so far is NOD.VH+/-Vk+/+.

### Genotyping

The genotyping protocols of both the [B6.VH125+/+ mouse](mouse-strains.md#b-6-vh-125) and the [B6.Vk125+/+ mouse](mouse-strains.md#b-6-vk-125) must be used to determine the genotype of this mouse.

## SAP-/- IL15-/-

These mice have both SAP gene and the IL15 gene knocked out of their genome.

Since the SAP gene is X-linked, males of this genotype are actually SAP-/y.

### Production

We currently have one true-breeding pair for this genotype.

These mice are produced by breeding SAP-/- IL15-/- mice with each other.

They can also be produced by breeding SAP-/- mice with IL15-/- mice a few generations until double homozygosity is reached.

### Genotyping

The genotyping protocols of both the [B6.SAP-/- mouse](mouse-strains.md#b-6-sap) and the [B6.IL15-/- mouse](mouse-strains.md#b-6-il-15) must be used to determine the genotype of this mouse.
