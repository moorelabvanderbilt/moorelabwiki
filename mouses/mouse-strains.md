# B6.VH125+/+
These mice have V<sub>H</sub>125 inserted into both copies of the genome, on a B6 background.

This mouse produces B-cells that produce anti-insulin antibodies.

This mouse has an anti-insulin gene (V<sub>H</sub>125) inserted, replacing the endogenous IgJ<sub>H</sub>3 allele. Because it is site-directed to the native IgJ<sub>H</sub>3, these B-cells are able to class switch and produce both IgM<sup>a</sup> and IgD<sup>a</sup> (as opposed to only IgMa in non-site-directed V<sub>H</sub>125Tg mice).

## Production
This strain is maintained by breeding B6.VH125+/+ mice with each other. 

It can also be achieved by breeding B6.VH125+/- mice with each other, then genotyping the pups with both protocols shown below to select the +/+ genotype.

## Genotyping VH125
This protocol confirms the presence of one *or* two copies of the VH125 allele. It does not differentiate between mice that are heterozygous and homozygous for VH125. To confirm homozygosity, the mice must also be genotyped using the Jh3 protocol below.

### Primers
**VH125 F**: 5’ CAG ATC CAG TTG GTG CAG TC 3’ (20bp) - VH125 gene  
**VH125 R**: 5’ CCA GAC ATC GAA GTA CCC CT 3’ (20bp) - wild-type Jh gene

# B6.VH+/+Vk+/+
These mice have both the V<sub>H</sub>125 gene and the V<sub>k</sub>125 gene inserted into both copies of the genome, on a NOD background.

## Production
We do not yet have true-breeding mice for this strain, but we are very close. We have not had any trouble achieving homozygosity in the single-transgene (B6.VH and B6.Vk), so there shouldn't be an issue reaching it with these double transgenic mice.

These mice are produced by breeding mice that are at least heterozygous for both transgenes together and genotyping the pups, selecting for those that are homozygous for both.

## Genotyping
The genotyping protocols of both the B6.VH125+/+ mouse and the B6.Vk125+/+ mouse must be used to determine the genotype of this mouse.
# NOD.VH125+/+
Ideally, these mice would have V<sub>H</sub>125 inserted into both copies of the genome, on a NOD background.

However, to date, we've been unable to produce homozygous-positive mice, and therefore are stuck with heterozygotes (VH125+/-).

## Production
Since we have not been able to achieve homozygosity, this genotype is not actually produced.

The VH125+/- mice are produced by breeding an NOD.VH125+/- with either an NOD or another NOD.VH125+/-.

## Genotyping
The genotyping protocol is the same as the the B6.VH125+/+ protocol above.
# NOD.Vk125+/+
These mice have V<sub>k</sub>125 inserted into both copies of the genome, on a NOD background.

## Production
This strain is maintained by breeding NOD.Vk125+/+ mice with each other. 

It can also be achieved by breeding NOD.Vk125+/- mice with each other, then genotyping the pups with both protocols shown below to select the +/+ genotype.

The NOD.Vk125+/- mice are produced by breeding an NOD.Vk125+/+ with an NOD.

## Genotyping
The genotyping protocol is the same as the the B6.Vk125+/+ protocol above.
# NOD.VH+/+Vk+/+
These mice have both the V<sub>H</sub>125 gene and the V<sub>k</sub>125 gene inserted into both copies of the genome, on a NOD background.

## Production
Because of the homozygous lethal problem with the NOD.VH125+/+ mice (noted above), we have been unable to produce a NOD.VH+/+Vk+/+ mouse. The closest we've gotten so far is NOD.VH+/-Vk+/+.

## Genotyping
The genotyping protocols of both the B6.VH125+/+ mouse and the B6.Vk125+/+ mouse must be used to determine the genotype of this mouse.
# SAP-/- IL15-/-
These mice have both SAP gene and the IL15 gene knocked out of their genome.

Since the SAP gene is X-linked, males of this genotype are actually SAP-/y.

## Production
We currently have one true-breeding pair for this genotype.

These mice are produced by breeding SAP-/- IL15-/- mice with each other.

They can also be produced by breeding SAP-/- mice with IL15-/- mice a few generations until double homozygosity is reached.

## Genotyping
The genotyping protocols of both the [B6.SAP-/- mouse](/mouses/mouse-strains#b-6-sap) and the [B6.IL15-/- mouse](/mouses/mouse-strains#b-6-il-15) must be used to determine the genotype of this mouse.
