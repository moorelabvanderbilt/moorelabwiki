# Mouse breeding

## For all breeding pairs

Place two mice in a cage. Activate a cage card and fill out a green breeder card with the information about the mating. Place both cards in the holder and put the mice on the rack. Wait.

Ideally, a breeding pair will have their first litter about 40 days after pairing.

Here are some suggestions for breeding success:

- Use a new cage whenever you pair mice for breeding. Males can be territorial and can refuse to mate if they detect the smell of _any_ other mice that have already lived in the cage. This includes the female mouse that will be in the cage with the male.
- Select new breeders in the age range of 5-9 weeks old. This is especially important for female mice, as older females are less likely to mate than younger ones.
- Select mice that have been housed apart from the opposite sex for at least a week, as mice housed co-ed style can be less likely to mate.
- Wean pups as soon as they are ready, especially when a new litter has been born. The older pups can crowd out the more vulnerable younger pups and prevent them from accessing their mother.

### When to retire a breeding cage

You don't want to waste money and space to keep unproductive breeding cages activated. For non-diabetic strains, I considered a cage as unproductive at the following points:

- Either of the mice is older than 9 months old. Mice can still have litters after this point, but most of the time the litter size will be small and it would be better to just replace the cage with a younger pair.
- It has been more than 60 days since the mice last had a litter. If mating is halted for this long, it is unlikely to ever restart with this pair.
- It has been more than 60 days since the mice were paired and the pair has not had a litter. This is the least bright-line rule of all of these, since it takes some strains a bit longer to get going, but generally 60 days after pairing is a good time to consider replacing the cage.

In addition to the above guidelines, for diabetic strains \(e.g. NOD\) the mothers need to be checked regularly for the onset of hyperglycemia. A hyperglycemic mother generally stops being attentive to the pups, and the pups often struggle to get enough nutrition from her to develop at a normal rate, and they can die before reaching adulthood. Pups should be fostered to a more fit mother \(see **When a mother is incapacitated**, below\).

### When a mother is incapacitated

If a mother can no longer care for a litter \(e.g. she has died, she has become hyperglycemic\), the pups need to be fostered. This means moving the pups to a healthier mother's cage.

This works best if the foster mother has pups of her own that are around the same age as the foster pups. It's obviously easiest if you can find a suitable mother of the same genotype, but if you can't, then transfer them to a different-colored foster mother so you can tell the pups apart when you wean them.

Carefully transfer the pups to the cage with the foster mother. Pick up some bedding from the cage with the foster mother and lightly cover the fostered pups with the bedding. This helps assimilate these pups to the odor of the new cage and aids in a successful adoption. Mice can be territorial, so the correct odor can keep the fostered pups from being killed by the foster parents. If these pups are especially important, remove the male breeder from the cage as the males are more likely to kill to protect territory. However, changing their odor with the bedding is enough to keep them safe in most instances.

## True-breeding mice

No special considerations are needed for true-breeding mice. True-breeding mice are those that produce offspring with the same genetics as the parents. Our basic strains \(B6, NOD\) are true-breeding. In addition, any transgenic mice that are homozygotic for all transgenes are true-breeding.

## Non-true-breeding mice

Mice that are not true breeding are heterozygotic \(having differing copies of alleles\). We typically try to get our strains to true-breeding status for ease of management, but during this process the mice will not be true-breeding and thus must be genotyped to determine which alleles they have present.

Some transgenes also prevent true-breeding status by being homozygous lethal, in which individuals with homozygosity for the transgene die before being born.

On the green breeder cards for non-true-breeders, it is good to record the two genotypes of the breeders, so it's easier to tell what genotype the offspring are expected to be.

The Matings tab of the **Mouse Colony** Google Sheet can be used to track the status of all the mating cages.
