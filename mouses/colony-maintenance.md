# Colony maintenance

This page is a collection of guidelines on how to keep the colony maintained by buying and breeding mice, and keeping it to a manageable level by sacking unnecessary mice.

## B6 and NOD

For the main strains of mice that we use, B6 and NOD, we need to both breed and buy new mice. Breeding is only to prevent us from having to buy _all_ of the mice that we use, and to maintain a baseline level of new B6 and NOD at all times. It would be impractical to produce enough B6 and NOD so that we would not have to buy any new ones.

### Breeding

I try to keep around 14 breeding cages each of these strains active at all times.

B6 mice are consistently productive when breeding, and often continue to produce pups even as the parents get old. I still replace them at around 9 months of age \(as outlined in [mouse breeding](mouse-breeding.md)\).

NOD mice are less productive, but still pretty reliable. This stops when they develop hyperglycemia, however, so the females should be checked regularly and any with hyperglycemia should be retired from breeding. If they still have pups when they develop hyperglycemia, they will need to be [fostered](mouse-breeding.md#when-a-mother-is-incapacitated).

### Buying

Since breeding these strains often can't keep up with the demand for them in experiments, it's a good idea to check with people in the lab on a regular basis to see if they'll need any large amounts of B6 or NOD mice for upcoming experiments.

If we are very low on 6-10 week old mice of either of these strains \(even if no one knows they'll need some\), I like to go ahead and purchase 2-3 cages of mice, just to be sure that we will have them if someone thinks of a last-minute experiment that they want to do. Grad students tend to be poor planners.

### Sacking

Generally, you can sack any B6 and NOD mice that are over 25 weeks of age, unless they are being kept for a specific purpose.

## Other strains

### Breeding

The number of breeding cages to keep around depends on how well that strain breeds, and how many mice of that strain you anticipate needing.

Generally, 2-6 breeding cages is enough for most strains.

NOD.uMT mice are not very productive breeders, and many pairs do not breed at all, so you may have to set up more breeding cages of these to produce enough mice.

NOD.RAG-/- are very productive breeders and often have large litters, so you may not need to set up as many of these to produce enough mice.

### Buying

Most mice you can buy if you need to \(see [strains](mouse-strains.md) for a listing of different strains and where to get them\). However, mice vary in price between strains, so if a strain is very expensive per mouse and you're going to need many of them, it would probably be better to breed them instead \(e.g. NOD.RAG-/- mice\).

Some mice are prohibitively expensive, or need to be recovered from cryopreservation, so buying these strains should be a last resort.

### Sacking

Sometimes larger quantities of a specific strain will need to be kept for experiments, so check with the lab before sacking any older mice.

## Maintenance mice

Some mice we keep only so we can maintain the genotype. We don't use these in experiments often, but they are not readily available for purchase. We'd like to keep these around, but we don't want to spend a lot of money on keeping their cages.

For mice like this, you should keep at most 2 mating cages and 1 cage each of males and females. When the mating needs to be replaced, I usually replace it with 2 new mating cages. When one starts producing pups, I sack the other one, since only one is needed to maintain the lineage.
