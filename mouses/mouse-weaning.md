<!-- TITLE: Mouse Weaning -->

When pups are 3 weeks old, they are old enough to be **weaned** from their parents. At this point, they will be able to eat and drink on their own, and their mother will likely be ready to give birth to a new litter.

# Weaning
Get two clean cages and open them up. These cages are to sort the weanlings by sex.

Get the breeding cage to be weaned and open it up. Remove the weanlings from the breeding cage one by one, placing the males in one of the clean cages and females in the other (see [sexing mice](/mouses/sexing) if you need help telling the sexes apart). 

Once all the weanlings are out of the breeding cage, put it back on the rack.

Figure out how many of each sex you have, then how many cages you'll need to fit them all in. I like to divide the mice somewhat evenly, so if there's 6 mice I'll make 2 cages of 3 mice, not 5 and 1.

Add a water bottle to each cage. Young mice sometimes have trouble acclimating to using the Lix-it on the back of the rack, so a water bottle ensures that they'll have access to water as they get used to living on their own. 

Add food to the cage.

Fill out cage cards for the weanlings' cages. Since these are new mice being added to the colony, you'll need to write the number of mice on the activation tab on the bottom of the card before tearing it off.

Place the weanlings' cages on the racks.
# Special situations
## More than one cage of the same type weaned at the same time
If you have more than one cage of a true breeding mouse that have similar wean dates, you can wean them all together. This can sometimes be more efficient because then you can get more full cages.

You could do this with transgenic mice too, of course, but it's much easier to track the family genetics if you don't mix transgenic progeny.
## Sterile housing
Sometimes, DAC will leave some sterile cages on the no-water rack. If they do, you can use those for NOD.RAG-/- weanings, but if not, just use the normal clean cages.

Technically, the normal clean supply cages are not completely sterile, but for NOD.RAG-/- mice, the normal cages will suffice until the next cage change. 
## The pups are too small
Occasionally, pups will not develop sufficiently in only 3 weeks. This is more likely if their litter was especially large or if the mother was inattentive (e.g. she was hyperglycemic), but it can just happen randomly as well. In this case, it's best to give the pups a little while longer with their mother.

Pups weaned when they are too small often die because they are not mature enough to provide care for themselves.

Often, DAC will notice these cases and place an orange health concern card on the cage, indicating that the pups are too small and that DAC will re-check their size at a later date. Usually they postpone weaning by about 1 week, but this depends on the pups' condition.

If DAC has not noticed the pups' size, but you think that the pups are too small to wean, place a light-orange health alert card on the cage, indicating that the pups are too small, and place the Alert magnet on the front of the room door. A vet tech will stop by the room to check the pups status and replace the health alert card with a health concern card.

Note that the presence of an overcrowd card is not indicative of the pups' readiness to be weaned. Overcrowd cards are typically placed by the animal care tech, not by a vet tech, so they do not reliably assess the maturity of the pups when they place overcrowd cards. If you think pups are too small, even if there is an overcrowd card on the cage, put a health alert card so the vet can come to confirm the pups' maturity.
