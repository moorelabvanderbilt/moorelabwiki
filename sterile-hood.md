# Sterile Hoods

The sterile hoods, or laminar flow cabinets, are two large semi-enclosed workbenches used for working in sterile conditions.

## Maintenance

Every year, the hoods have to be inspected and recertified. Jim Llewellyn from Fil-Cert takes care of this for us. He can also do minor repairs on the hood if it needs it.

Usually, it's best to give him a call in mid-November to schedule a date for him to come in early December.

Before he arrives, be sure to remove everything from the hoods so he has unobstructed airflow for the certification.

For billing, ask him to make two invoices, one for the large hood and one for the smaller hood. In the past, the Moore lab has paid for the large hood and the Jacobson lab for the small hood, but this can be renegotiated if needed. Fil-Cert is listed as Fil Cert Inc in eProcurement.
