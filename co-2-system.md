# CO2 system

The CO2 system supplies the incubator with carbon dioxide. Cells grown in the incubator need the media to be kept at an optimal pH \(around 7\). Typically media contains dissolved bicarbonate \(HCO3-\) in order to maintain this pH, but at normal air concentrations of CO2, the bicarbonate would dissociate to H2O and CO2 and evaporate into the air. Therefore, in order to keep the media at the correct pH, the atmosphere in the incubator is kept at 5% CO2 to keep the bicarbonate in solution.

## Reading the gauges

The tanks each have a regulator on them, as pictured. The regulator controls how fast the gas is allowed to escape from the tank.

![tank regulator](.gitbook/assets/co-2-system-00006-a.jpg)

The regulator has two gauges:

* **Regulator pressure gauge**: indicates the pressure of the gas leaving the regulator, into the tank switcher. This should be around 10 psi \(lbs/in\). Adjust this using the pressure regulator knob.  
* **High pressure gauge**: indicates the amount of gas remaining in the tank. When this reads zero, the tank is empty!

The regulator has two knobs:

* **Pressure regulator knob**: controls the pressure of the gas leaving the regulator.
* **Regulator outlet knob**: when closed, prevents gas from leaving the regulator. When open, allows gas to leave the regulator. You most likely will not have to adjust this one.

The tanks themselves also have a knob, the **cylinder valve**, which when closed, prevents the gas from leaving the tank. If you want to turn off a tank, use this knob.

## Controlling the gas

At most junctions in the system, there is a way to shut off the gas. If you are going to disconnect the tubing for any reason, **shut off the closest valves to where you're disconnecting**. It would not be cool to fill the entire lab space with CO2. If you want to be _absolutely_ sure, you can shut off both tanks.

The tanks both have a knob on the top, the **cylinder valve**, which shuts off the tank. These knobs have arrows on the top indicating which way to turn it to open or close the valve.

In addition, both the wall junctions have a valve on them. This is controlled via the **yellow handle**. When the yellow handle is parallel to the pipe, the valve is open and gas is allowed to flow. When the handle is perpendicular to the pipe, the valve is closed and gas is not flowing.

When you shut off a valve and disconnect tubing, you may hear some gas escaping. This is normal. There will be a small amount of gas trapped in the plumbing when you close valves, and it will escape when you disconnect tubing. If it continues for more than a few seconds, you have done something wrong. Find and close the nearest valve, closest to the tanks from where you are.

## Tank switcher

The tank switcher serves as an intermediary between the tanks and the incubator.

When one of the tanks runs out, the tank switcher automatically switches to the other tank to keep the flow of CO2 constant.

![tank switcher front](.gitbook/assets/co-2-system-00010-a.jpeg)

The front of the tank switcher has two sets of lights \(a set for each tank\) and a switch in the middle.

* The **pressure light** blinks green when that tank is the one actively being used. It is solid green when that tank has pressure but is not currently being used.
* The **tank empty light** is solid red when that tank is empty.
* The **on/off switch** switches the power of the tank switcher. Turning off the switcher _does not_ stop the flow of gas - it simply continues letting gas through the tank that was last selected when the switcher was powered off.

The tank switcher will sound an alarm when one tank runs out. To turn off this alarm, simply switch the on/off switch off and then back on.

![tank switcher back](.gitbook/assets/co-2-system-00008-a.jpeg)

The back of the tank switcher has three quick-release ports, two for the tanks and one as the output. These are all size 1/4-inch \(6mm\) OD.

The model of the tank switcher is [TREG-SO1 SwitchOver CO2 Cylinder Automatic Backup Switcher from Tritech Research](http://www.tritechresearch.com/TREG-SO1.html).

## Ordering replacement tanks

When one of the tanks has run out, you'll need to order a replacement.

We rely on **A&L Compressed Gas** for our CO2.

> A&L Compressed Gas  
> 615.254.1457

Call them and tell them you are calling from Vanderbilt University and that you need to order a CO2 tank.

They commonly ask several questions, to which the answers are:

* **Account number**: VUMC148
* **Building**: MRB4
* **Room**: 7415A
* **What do you want?**: one 50 pound tank of CO2

They'll then confirm with an order number and tell you when to expect the tank.  
Usually they have the tank to you within a couple days.

## Plumbing

### Removing/reattaching tubing

#### Quick-release fittings

The quick-release fittings are the ones with the little plastic ring around the tube. These are the ones on the tank side, connecting all the red tubing.

To remove the tube, press and hold the plastic ring down onto the metal fitting. While holding it down, pull the tube out with the other hand. It may stick a little, but that's normal.

To reattach the tube, just insert the tube into the fitting and press firmly in. It should go about 1/2-inch into the fitting.

#### Regular fittings

The regular fittings are the ones that look like a threaded metal cone, and the tube just fits over the end of the cone part.

To remove, just pull until it comes off. These can be pretty tough to remove. If it seems like it's going to be too much trouble to get it off, cut a slit in the tubing against the fitting with a razor blade until the tubing can be removed easily.

To reattach, push the tubing onto the fitting. If the tubing is too brittle to fit over the fitting, replace the tubing.

### Replacing parts

You probably won't have to do any replacements, but just in case, here's how I put it all together.

If you remove any of these fittings, you should replace the teflon tape around the threads before putting it back together. This will make it easier to tighten and prevent it from seizing so it will remain easy to remove in the future.

Just take the teflon tape and stretch it once around the threads of the fitting, as pictured.

#### Tank side

![tank side plumbing](.gitbook/assets/co-2-system-00012-a.jpeg)

This is the plumbing setup that comes off the tank regulator. It is the same for both tanks.

* The **tank regulator** fitting is 1/4-inch MNPT \(male National Pipe Thread\).
* The [**coupling**](https://www.grainger.com/product/GRAINGER-APPROVED-Brass-Coupling-46M499) is 1/4-inch FNPT \(female National Pipe Thread\) on both sides.
* The [**adapter**](https://www.grainger.com/product/SMC-1-4-Brass-Male-Adapter-36X027) is 1/4-inch MNPT on the metal side, and on the tubing side it accepts 1/4-inch OD \(outer diameter\) tubing.
* The [**tubing**](https://www.grainger.com/product/GRAINGER-APPROVED-50-ft-Extruded-Polyurethane-2LZF8) is polyurethane, 1/4-inch OD, and 5/32-inch ID \(inner diameter\).

#### Wall side

![wall side plumbing](.gitbook/assets/co-2-system-00013-a.jpeg)

This is the plumbing setup that goes into the wall above the CO2 tanks.

* The **wall plumbing** is 1/4-inch FNPT.
* The [**adapter**](https://www.grainger.com/product/SMC-1-4-Brass-Male-Adapter-36X027) is 1/4-inch MNPT on the metal side, and on the tubing side it accepts 1/4-inch OD \(outer diameter\) tubing.
* The [**tubing**](https://www.grainger.com/product/GRAINGER-APPROVED-50-ft-Extruded-Polyurethane-2LZF8) is polyurethane, 1/4-inch OD, and 5/32-inch ID \(inner diameter\).

#### Incubator

![incubator side plumbing](.gitbook/assets/co-2-system-00011.jpg)

This is the plumbing that comes from the wall in 7410C and goes into the incubator.

Our tank output \(labeled **Tank 4**\) supplies both our incubator and the Russell lab incubator.

This is the only plumbing that I didn't replace, so I'm not sure of the exact measurements of everything.  
Based on some quick measurements and my rudimentary knowledge of polymers, I think the tubing is **1/4-inch ID polyethylene**.  
The adapters where the tubing is pushed onto are called **barb fittings**.

While the quick-release polyurethane tubing and fittings are easier to connect and disconnect, you probably won't have to disconnect the incubator from the wall very often. Therefore, I would NOT recommend that you change these fittings to the quick-release style, since that would involve swapping the fitting on the incubator itself.
