<!-- TITLE: Minus 80 Freezer -->

Our -80&deg;C freezer is where we store stuff that needs to be *real* cold.

It's pretty low maintenance, but here's some things that might come up.
# Monitoring service
The freezer is connected to a monitoring service that is run by the Delta Operations Center, at Vanderbilt Plant Services.

If the alarm goes off, they will be alerted. They will come check out the freezer and call the contact person (you) if something is amiss.

If the alarm goes off, but you already know about it and it's not anything to worry about (like you had the door open for a while, so the temperature rise is normal), call the peeps at Delta Ops.

# Troubleshooting
## The door won't open
The freezer has a vacuum system that starts after you close the door. This vacuum should exist shortly after closing the door, but should vent fairly quickly. 

If it still cannot be opened after a minute or so, the vent is probably frozen over.

The vent is located on the left side of the freezer, at the top near the front. 

Here is what it looks like on the outside:

And here's what it looks like on the inside when it's frozen over:

Ice on the inside that is clogging the vent can be broken off by pressing in firmly on the plunger on the vent. This should vent the vacuum and allow the door to be opened again.

## The alarm is going off
The freezer will begin sounding an alarm if it heats up above a set threshold (-75&deg;C).

If this is expected, because the door has been open for a bit or something reasonable like that, then press the **Silence alarm** button on the control panel and call the Monitoring Service as outlined above.

If this is not expected, and the freezer continues to heat up, something is wrong. Continue to **The freezer is heating up** below.

## The freezer is heating up
Do not open the freezer (yet). This will warm it faster, which is counterproductive until you are absolutely sure that there's nothing that can be done.

First, make sure the freezer is on. It has an internal circuit breaker that will shut off the main power if needed, so that may be what happened. Even if it is still on, turn it off and then back on.

### Power cycle the freezer
Get the keys to the freezer power button. These are in a bag in the filing cabinet, in the pink folder. The instructions to the freezer are also in there, if you'd like to look at those.

Open the freezer power button hatch. This is located on the front of the freezer, on the bottom right side. The key with teeth only on one side are the ones you need. The key goes in with the teeth facing down.

The white switch (the bigger one) is the power switch. Switch it off (press the top side in), wait 60 seconds, then switch it back on (press the bottom side in).

Did you hear the soft hum of the compressor starting back up? Is the temperature returning to normal? 

If so, great! You fixed it.

If not, it's broken. You need help from someone more knowledgeable. 
* If it's during the workday, call Plant Services. They have freezer specialists that can come look at it.
* If it's nighttime, the freezer specialists are (probably) not here right now. You'll have to wait until the next workday to call them in. Continue to **Move all the stuff** below.

Just for reference, the other switch behind the hatch on the freezer is for the backup battery. This should stay on all the time, unless you're going to power down the freezer for an extended amount of time.

### Move all the stuff
As a last resort, you need to get everything out of the malfunctioning freezer until you can get it fixed.

Look for other people's -80&deg; freezers. You're probably going to want at least two to go to. Make a note of whose freezers they are. Call Plant Services, Delta Operations and let them know that several freezers are going to alarm soon, and which ones you have chosen.

Get a rolling cart. Push it up next to the freezer. Open the door to the freezer and put as much stuff as you can on the cart.

When you have a bunch of stuff, close our freezer door and move the cart next to another freezer.

Working as quickly as you can, open the other freezer and start putting our stuff in it. The freezer will likely start alarming, both because you have it open and because you're putting a load of warm-ish stuff in it. After you've put a good amount of stuff in, close the door and move to another freezer. Alternate between other freezers to prevent any of them from gaining too much temperature.

When you've moved all the stuff on the cart, repeat the process until everything is moved out of our freezer.

When our freezer is empty, access the power panel as outlined above, and turn the power *and* battery switch off (press the top side in, on both switches). Prop the door open a bit and place a bunch of paper towels underneath it and the main freezer opening. Now that the power is off, the ice accumulated inside will begin to melt and you'd like to prevent a giant puddle from forming on the floor.

Write a quick email to the people whose freezers you've commandeered to put your stuff in, informing them of the situation. 

That's all you can do for now. Get someone from Plant Services in to service the freezer at the next opportunity.

Go get some Cookout, since this probably happened at 3am and you're tired and stressed. There's no stress reliever like a Big Double Cheddar Style.
