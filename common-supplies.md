# Common supplies

_This page current as of 3 July 2017._

This page outlines some of the more common supplies that we order and where we normally get them from.

Obviously, prices and suppliers can change, so it's best to shop around occasionally, especially for these commonly purchased items.

## Office supplies

**Printer toner**  
Assuming that Dan hasn't Office Space'd the printer by now, the toner that we use comes from CDW in eCatalogs. The black cartridges are available recycled, so those are cheaper, but the color ones are cheaper to buy as a new 3-pack.

**Writing utensils**  
Pens, pencils, and markers come from Guy Brown in eCatalogs.

## Pipette tips

**Micropipetter tips**  
These come from VWR in eCatalogs. There are probably cheaper options out there, but these Neptune tips are the ones we decided worked best a while ago.

**Conical tubes**  
These come from Fisher and Genesee, whichever has them cheaper at the time.

| Falcon 15mL Conical Centrifuge Tubes | Fisher | 14-959-49B |

**PCR tubes**  
I like the individually capped tubes for tail collection \(from USA Scientific, regular requisition\), and the cap strip tubes for actually running PCR \(from Fisher\).

## Buffer

This can be bought at the Core, but they often don't have the quantity that we need on a regular basis. Ordering it from Fisher in bulk keeps us from being dependent on their supply.
