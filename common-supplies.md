<!-- TITLE: Common Supplies -->

*This page current as of 3 July 2017.*

This page outlines some of the more common supplies that we order and where we normally get them from.

Obviously, prices and suppliers can change, so it's best to shop around occasionally, especially for these commonly purchased items. 

# Office supplies
**Printer toner**  
Assuming that Dan hasn't Office Space'd the printer by now, the toner that we use comes from CDW in eCatalogs. The black cartridges are available recycled, so those are cheaper, but the color ones are cheaper to buy as a new 3-pack.

# Buffer
This can be bought at the Core, but they often don't have the quantity that we need on a regular basis. Ordering it from Fisher in bulk keeps us from being dependent on their supply.
